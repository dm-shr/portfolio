          My name is Dmitrii (Dima for short), I am a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a passion
          for NLP and bioinformatics.

          I have an extensive background in software engineering and data science, where I worked on
          a variety of projects - from RAG & Agents within finances and EdTech to NLP pipelines
          for HR and investor relations, from analytics to putting ML models into production.
